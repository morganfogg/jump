# Jump - Bookmark Directories in the Terminal

This is a set of scripts that let you create "bookmarks" of commonly used folders in your shell and instantly navigate
to them with a single, short command. Your bookmarks are persisted to a file on your computer, so bookmarks created in
one shell are instantly available on all other shell instances and even across different shells. This means you can, for
instance, create a bookmark in Bash and load it in Fish or Powershell. On Windows, it also allows you to share bookmarks
between regular Powershell, WSL and Cygwin.

The following environments are supported:

- [Bash, Zsh and other `sh`-like shells](./jump.sh)
- [Fish](./jump.fish)
- [PowerShell](./jump.ps1)

## Setup

Clone the scripts into a folder on your computer, e.g.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/morganfogg/jump.git ~/.jumpscripts
```

Then load it from your profile:

#### Bash and Zsh

Add the following to the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

```sh
. ~/.jumpscripts/jump.sh
```

#### Fish

Add to the bottom of your `~/config/fish/config.fish`

```fish
source ~/.jumpscripts/jump.fish
```

#### PowerShell

Add this to the bottom of your `$PROFILE`

```powershell
. "$HOME/.jumpscripts/jump.ps1"
```

If this fails to load, you may need to first update your exection policy to allow script execution.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Usage

In Bash, Zsh and Fish, Jump is used through the `jump` or `j` command.

```sh
j -c [name]   # Add a new bookmark which points to the working directory
j [name]      # Go to bookmark
j -r [name]   # Delete bookmark
j -g          # List all bookmarks, or print a bookmark's path if a name is provided
j --prune     # Delete any bookmark which no longer points to a valid location on the filesystem.
```

In Powershell, Jump follows the standard Verb-Noun naming convention. The commands are:

| Alias | Full Name          | Effect                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| j     | Open-Bookmark      | Go to the bookmark                                             |
| jc    | Add-Bookmark       | Create a new bookmark to working directory                     |
| jr    | Remove-Bookmark    | Delete a bookmark                                              |
| jg    | Get-Bookmark       | Print all bookmarks, or a given bookmark if provided           |
| ju    | Update-Bookmark    | Updates an existing bookmark to point to the working directory |
